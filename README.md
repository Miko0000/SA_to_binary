# SA_to_binary<br>

SA (Signals Analyzer) from http://signals.radioscanner.ru/info/item21/
has some built-in generic decoders that can be used to get the raw binary from FSK and PSK
type signals.

This program turns the ASCII output from SA's decoders into binary files, which can then be
analyzed further in a hex editor or binary viewer.

### This program is not completely finished yet!

It does work, but it's really only useful for 1's and 0's currently.

## Features

Other than converting the ASCII to binary which is described below this program can also:

* Shift the output by 1-7 bits
* Invert the output
* Reverse the bit order in a byte

### Note: Shift works by placing extra 0's at the beginning of the file.

## Operation

This is how the converter works:

First it takes ASCII characters and converts them into their corresponding binary number
according to the table below. (soon an option to use a custom table will be added..)

### Note: If type is not given, the default is 2.

```
    | TYPE: | IN: |  OUT:  |
    |:-----:|:---:|:------:|
    |   2   |  0  |  0     |
    |       |  1  |  1     |
    |:-----:|:---:|:------:|
    |  3-4  |  2  |  10    |
    |       |  3  |  11    |
    |:-----:|:---:|:------:|
    |  5-8  |  4  |  100   |
    |       |  5  |  101   |
    |       |  6  |  110   |
    |       |  7  |  111   |
    |:-----:|:---:|:------:|
    | 9-16  |  8  |  1000  |
    |       |  9  |  1001  |
    |       |  A  |  1010  |
    |       |  B  |  1011  |
    |       |  C  |  1100  |
    |       |  D  |  1101  |
    |       |  E  |  1110  |
    |       |  F  |  1111  |
    |:-----:|:---:|:------:|
    | 17-32 |  G  |  10000 |
    |       |  H  |  10001 |
    |       |  I  |  10010 |
    |       |  J  |  10011 |
    |       |  K  |  10100 |
    |       |  L  |  10101 |
    |       |  M  |  10110 |
    |       |  N  |  10111 |
    |       |  O  |  11000 |
    |       |  P  |  11001 |
    |       |  Q  |  11010 |
    |       |  R  |  11011 |
    |       |  S  |  11100 |
    |       |  T  |  11101 |
    |       |  U  |  11110 |
    |       |  V  |  11111 |

```

### Note: This program will ignore other characters that are not found in the table.

It then concatenates the bits until a "full" byte is achived.

### Note: Depending on -t, a bit from the table may be saved as a di-bit, tri-bit ...

In case cancatenating 2 or more bits results in more than 8 bits, the program splits them.
One byte is saved and the other remaining bits continue to be concatenated with more bits
until a "full" byte is reached again. Once there are no more bits from the input file left, if
there are any remaining concatenated bits that do not make a byte, they are then padded with 0's.

### Important:

The bits are saved to the file MSb first! Using the reverse bit order option, they will be saved LSb first!

Ex. 1:

```
Type: 2
Input: 111010110

 1 is 1, 0 is 0 ...

Output: 111010110

Because the last bits don't make a byte, the program pads the output and the result is:

Output: 1110101100000000
```

Ex. 2:

```
Type: 4
Input: 10103201

 1 is 01, 0 is 00 ...

Output: 0100010011100001

```

Ex. 3:

```
Type: 16
Input: A12345

 A is 1010, 1 is 0001, 2 is 0010 ...

Output: 101011011100101

Because the last bits don't make a byte, the program pads the output and the result is:

Output: 1010110111001010

```

Ex. 4:

```
Type: 2
Input: AA11

A will get ignored, 1 is 1 ...

Output: 11

Because the last bits don't make a byte, the program pads the output and the result is:

Output: 11000000

```


## Compiling

On linux you can run this in a terminal if you have g++ installed:

```
g++ main.cpp -o sa_to_binary
```

Currently this program works best on Linux.
At least compiling for Windows on Linux seems to break something. It runs, but doesn't convert correctly.

## TODO

* Find a way to compile for Windows so that the program works properly like on Linux.
* Add option: Try different combinations by rotating the table
* Add option: Try all combinations.
* Add option: Convert using custom table.

## GUI TODO

* Remove unusued lines of code, unfreed references, unusued files, etc
* Add installer for Windows
* Add uninstaller
* Add more options
* Add custom table
* Fix memory leak
